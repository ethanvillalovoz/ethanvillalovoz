### 👋 About Me

I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from Washington State University. I’ve conducted research in AI, robotics, and machine learning at institutions like Carnegie Mellon University (HARP Lab), Oregon State University, and WSU. I’ve also interned at Google as a STEP intern, where I worked on scalable internal tools using C++, SQL, and HTML.

What each readme project should have

Section

Tips

Badges

Also known as shields. Highlight information about the project, for example downloads or build status

Introduction

Keep this short about the goal of the project

Description

Go into more details about the project

Visuals

This will really help your README and project standout, use screenshots or animated gifs

Prerequisites / requirements

What the user is required to have already installed, for example Docker

Technologies used in the project

Projects usually use a lot of libraries and frameworks, an exhaustive list is not required. However, it is useful to list the main technologies, for example React with TailwindCSS

QuickStart guide

How people can get started with the basics, this needs to be straight forward and the path for least resistance

Advanced usage

How people can do more with your project

Configuration

This can be from private keys and tokens to customizing the project

Automated test

This will give confidence that the project is working locally with the relevant dependencies

Roadmap

What features are coming up, this can be a list or table, but also have a look at Github Project boards (GitHub themselves use this for their roadmap)

Contribution

GitHub does allow for a specific CONTRIBUTORS.md file, however a brief overview in the README could be useful
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Folder Structure:

Most projects have a similar based folder structure of:

src/

tests/

.gitignore

LICENSE

README.md

...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-->

<!--
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documanetation advice:

The README should include:

What the project goals are

What does it look like

What are the prerequisites that are required (for example node v12+)

As the README grows, it is recommended to use the docs/ folder to have it separated into sections.

Architecture
SOLID principles improve project maintainability by decoupling, reducing duplication and encouraging re-use.

Principle

Abbreviation

Description

Single Responsibility Principle

SRP

Class should only have one job

Open / Closed Principle

OCP

Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification 

Liskov substitution principle

LSP

Every concrete class should be substitutable for their parent class

Interface segregation principle

ISP

Interfaces should be specific and not general

Dependency Inversion Principle

DIP

Depend on abstractions rather than concrete classes
