### 👋 About Me

I recently graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics from Washington State University. I’ve conducted research in AI, robotics, and machine learning at institutions like Carnegie Mellon University (HARP Lab), Oregon State University, and WSU. I’ve also interned at Google as a STEP intern, where I worked on scalable internal tools using C++, SQL, and HTML.
